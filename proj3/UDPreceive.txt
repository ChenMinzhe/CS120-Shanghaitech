10.20.203.209 100 I used to rule the world
10.20.203.209 100 Seas would rise when I gave the word
10.20.203.209 100 Now in the morning I sleep alone
10.20.203.209 100 Sweep the streets I used to own
10.20.203.209 100 I used to roll the dice
10.20.203.209 100 Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
10.20.203.209 100 Listen as the crowd would sing:
10.20.203.209 100 "Now the old king is dead
10.20.203.209 100 Long live the king "
10.20.203.209 100 One minute I held the key
10.20.203.209 100 Next the walls were closed on me
10.20.203.209 100 And I discovered that my castles stand
10.20.203.209 100 Upon pillars of salt' pillars of sand
10.20.203.209 100 I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
10.20.203.209 100 Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
10.20.203.209 100 Be my mirror my sword and shield
10.20.203.209 100 My missionaries in a foreign field
10.20.203.209 100 For some reason I can't explain
10.20.203.209 100 Once you go there was never
10.20.203.209 100 Never an honest word
10.20.203.209 100 That was when I ruled the world
10.20.203.209 100 It was the wicked and wild wind
10.20.203.209 100 Blew down the doors to let me in
10.20.203.209 100 Shattered windows and the sound of drums
10.20.203.209 100 People couldn't believe what I'd become
10.20.203.209 100 Revolutionaries wait
10.20.203.209 100 For my head on a silver plate
10.20.203.209 100 Just a puppet on a lonely string
10.20.203.209 100 Oh who would ever wanna be king
10.20.203.209 100 I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
